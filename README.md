1. Click on the button "Fork."
   
2. In terminal cd to the folder you want the clone the be in.
   e.g. some commands that could be useful
   <table>
    <tr>
      <th>pwd</th>
      <th>preasent work directory</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>cd</th>
      <th>change directory</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>ls</th>
      <th>list files</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>mkdir {name}</th>
      <th>create new folder</th>
    </tr>
   </table>
   
   **Add $ if needed in front!**

2. Clone your forked repository to your computer:

    e.g. run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/3d-rgb-sphere.git
    ```
    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

4. Shift to project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 3d-rgb-sphere
    ```

5. Install three.js and gsap:

    ```bash
    i three gsap
    ```

6. Run the folder on a local host.
    e.g. I used [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for this project
